# Table
Hi there! :wave:\
This table of students, it helps to keep a convenient and strictly filled teacher's journal :book: visits and grades in
the classroom. It will also easily help to calculate which of the students will receive an automatic credit by calculating according
to the formula (average score > 4 and the share of missed classes for a disrespectful reason <=10%)

# Getting Started with Create React App
I used TypeScript on the project, so you will need it in extensions.\
You can use the command:

### `yarn create react-app my-app --template typescript`
###or
### `npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript`
\
You can read the instructions here
[create react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

For a better layout of the code in CSS files, I used SASS

###`yarn add sass`
###or
###`npm i sass`

After that you can start the project

### `yarn start`
###or
###`npm start`
____

###In this project I used libraries such as:
* Redux
* react-redux
* react-router-dom
* uuid
* material-ui
    * material-ui/icons
    * material-ui/lab
* sass
* styled-components

#TDD
In the project, I used the TDD approach, which allowed me to speed up writing code.
To check Tests, use the command:
###`yarn test`
These Tests check the logic for adding, deleting, sorting and changing the student's first or last name,
as well as changing the grade, and the logic of the automatic credit.

####A few words about the project
I tried to write this project with an OOP approach, it's up to you to decide how much it turned out.
I also imitated the rest api / axios, would be a server, there would be an implementation :yum:.\
