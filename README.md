# Table
Hi there! :wave:\
This table of students, it helps to keep a convenient and strictly filled teacher's journal :book: visits and grades in
the classroom. It will also easily help to calculate which of the students will receive an automatic credit by calculating according
to the formula (average score > 4 and the share of missed classes for a disrespectful reason <=10%)

# Getting started with the application
I used TypeScript on the project.\
Clone the application and write the following commands in it:

### `yarn install`

After that you can start the project

### `yarn start`
____

## In this project I used libraries such as:
* Redux
* redux toolkit
* react-redux
* react-router-dom
* uuid
* material-ui
    * material-ui/icons
    * material-ui/lab
* sass

# TDD
In the project, I used the TDD approach, which allowed me to speed up writing code.
To check Tests, use the command:
### `yarn test`
These Tests check the logic for adding, deleting, sorting and changing the student's first or last name,
as well as changing the grade, and the logic of the automatic credit.

#### A few words about the project
I tried to write this project with an OOP approach, it's up to you to decide how much it turned out.
I also imitated the rest api / axios, would be a server, there would be an implementation :yum:.
